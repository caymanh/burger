 ### Description

 Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

 The app is built using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql/) and a homemade ORM to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
